aS'I have a confession to make. I\'m an Android guy. I\'ve always owned Samsung phones and Windows computers, and tell family members to get Amazon Fire But some of the smartest people I know swear by Apple products, and after playing with the new Apple TV for the last few days, I can see why. I\'ve tested just about every other box and stick from The remote is simply the best I\'ve ever used. Equipped with a responsive, thumb-sized touchpad it flies through menus, lists of TV show thumbnails and videos themselves, putting conventional cursor-based controls to shame. And voice search -- I guess you Apple people call it "Siri" for some reason -- works very well, and can do a lot more than just find stuff to watch. The new Apple TV is not perfect. It costs more than comparable devices -- always my main gripe about Apple products. It lets you play plenty of games, but titles originally designed for phones and tablets aren\'t necessarily as appealing on a big screen, and most work best with a third-party game controller. And it galls me that the Apple TV remote is so good, I\'d have to keep it around in addition to my My main issue though is lack of a real app for Amazon Video, my second-favorite streaming video service after Netflix. I don\'t know who to blame, Amazon or Apple or the streaming gods themselves, but regardless, it doesn\'t make any sense, especially since there\'s an Amazon app for iPhones and iPads. With Amazon\'s recent decision to If you\'re an Apple fan who owns a lot of TV shows, movies and games on Apple devices already, the new Apple TV is absolutely worth the money. For people like me, however, it\'s a tougher sell. I like To get the most out of Apple TV you need to be invested already in the Apple universe, with games, TV shows and movies you\'ve purchased from iTunes and the App Store. That\'s a shame since it offers the best streaming experience today, and more potential tomorrow once app developers go to town finding ways to exploit the big screen and that slick remote. But if the previous Apple TV was any indication, this one\'s only going to grow more appealing. Same black brick, different feel altogether It\'s been more than three and a half years since the first Apple TV went on sale, but Apple didn\'t break the physical mold. Glossy edges, rounded corners, a matte top with the requisite logo -- the two black boxes look basically identical. The new one is 0.4 inch taller, weighs 5.4 ounces more and felt like a solid brick when I pulled it out of the box. In every important way, the new Apple TV feels better than the old one to use. It starts with the new remote. It has a touchpad, a few more buttons and a familiar mic icon to evoke Siri, the name for Apple\'s disembodied female voice assistant (DFVA). Unlike Siri on a phone (or Alexa, the DFVA on Amazon\'s The remote\'s touchpad is sensitive and fast, with just the right amount of friction, and the perfect size for one-thumb operation. It took a second to realize I had to click it to select anything, rather than just tap, but immediately afterward I was blowing through menus, zooming across thumbnails and navigating quicker than with any plodding click-based control. The menus let you choose a tracking speed. As someone who loves living dangerously, I chose "fast." And those menus look different too. A clean white canvas to fill with the app icons you know from your phone, the new Apple TV home page allows nearly full customization. One of the first things I did after installing everything I wanted was to move Netflix, Hulu and HBO to the top row, along with Disney Junior for the kids, and move iTunes down a few rows since I don\'t buy many TV shows and movies from Apple. The top-row app you select expands above to show content within (as chosen by the app itself). The old Apple TV came with numerous screen savers which appear after a period of inactivity. On the new one, for now, you just have a choice of your own photos or something called Aerial (above). Trust me, you should go with Aerial. It\'s a stunning collection of cityscapes, landscapes and landmarks shot in slow motion, and looks so good you might feel reluctant to ever turn your TV off. Exploring the app store on a 65-inch screen To fill Apple TV\'s white canvas you\'ll head to the app store, which is at heart the biggest difference between the old and the new Apple TV. And again it feels a lot like the store on an iPhone or iPad, with fewer choices (for now) and bigger icons. The Purchased tab lists all of the apps you\'ve installed on other devices that are also compatible with Apple TV. You download and install them individually, picking and choosing which ones you like (although I did wish for a big "Install all" button). In most cases if you\'ve already paid for the app or game, it will be available for free on the Apple TV too -- but the decision to grandfather earlier purchases or charge you again is left up to each app\'s publisher. You\'ll have to sign in individually to each app that requires it of course, but once that happens your Apple TV will be fully armed and operational. During my test period, the store had nearly every TV-centric app available on the old box, from Netflix to PBS to NFL. It also offers most of the company\'s staples like Apple Music, Photos (which draws from your iCloud and shared photos from friends) and Computers (which can access Macs on your home network to share iTunes libraries). That\'s just the top row of the new app store, however. Others are devoted to games, apps for kids and something called "Best New Apps," which gathers in the miscellany like Periscope, QVC, Zillow and Airbnb. I\'m sure new categories will be added very soon as the app store expands, and during my test period new games and apps appeared every day. Apple says "hundreds" of apps will be available when the store opens. One-thumb gaming The first thing to know about gaming on the Apple TV is that you can always use the included remote; you don\'t need to buy a separate controller. The second thing is that with many games, a controller simply works better. Most of the titles I played worked fine with the included touchpad remote, and there\'s something to be said about gaming with one thumb. I easily could hold my infant son while I played Crossy Road, for example. That addictive chicken-smasher, with its simple controls and graphics, played beautifully and looked great on the big screen. So did JetPack Joyride and Bandland, both of which mainly consist of timed jumping. Slightly more complex controls worked well at times, for example steering on Does Not Commute (tapping either side of the pad) or swinging a bat with Beat Sports (swiping to move a bit, and swinging the controller like a Nintendo Wii). Where the touchpad controller failed for me was with quick movements requiring precise directions, like flying the ship in Geometry Wars, or directing the character to move across the map or attack something in Oceanhorn and Transistor. One of the titles with the most complex controls at launch is Galaxy on Fire: Manticore Rising (above), exclusive to Apple TV for now. A space-based arcade shooter, it incorporates the remote\'s position as well as swipes and clicks on the touchpad. It played surprisingly well considering all that, and again only required one hand. Two of the driving games, Asphalt 8 and Beach Buggy Racing, required me to put down my kid and hold the controller horizontally, like a steering wheel. Both were pretty forgiving and fun, but I definitely missed the precision of the controller. I tried most of those games with a Graphics, for what these games are, looked very impressive across the board. Even simple games like Crossy Road have been tuned up for the big screen, and higher-end titles like Galaxy on Fire and Transistor looked particularly good. A choice of sizes: 32GB vs. 64GB In true Apple fashion the box comes in two otherwise identical flavors, one with 32GB and one with 64GB of onboard storage. Unlike the Amazon Fire TV, Nvidia Shield and Roku 4 with their SD card slots, there\'s no way to add storage yourself if you need it. If you\'re really into gaming on Apple TV, then the more expensive version with twice the storage might be worthwhile. But people used to filling up their phones and tablets with photos, videos and games should realize that Apple TV accesses photos and video via the cloud, so they don\'t need to be stored on the device itself. That leaves games, and Apple TV\'s operating system, TVOS, uses an a aggressive storage management system. It mandates small initial downloads (just 200MB per app) augmented by "on-demand resources," little chunks of data that can be downloaded quickly and deleted at need if the device fills up. The end result is that only very heavy gamers should expect to need the 64GB version. What can you watch on Apple TV? For a comprehensive list of Apple TV\'s current TV and audio apps versus the competition, check out our Games and miscellaneous apps are neat, but most of the hours on the new Apple TV will be logged watching TV. And with the glaring exception of Amazon, the Apple TV is as good as any TV-based streamer for video app access. Yes, you can use'

aS'Francesco D\'Alessio struggled with even basic chores. He was forgetful and had trouble keeping up with his schoolwork. After failing a year at his high school in the UK when he was 16, D\'Alessio began looking for answers. Some tech blogs suggested a book by David Allen called "Getting Things Done" (or GTD for short). In it, the productivity consultant discusses processes he developed to help high-powered executives manage the barrage of information coming at them. Four years later, D\'Alessio says those processes turned him into a successful entrepreneur and student, studying business at England\'s Plymouth University. "I\'ve been able to accomplish a lot more than the average student has," he says. Count D\'Alessio among the growing number of productivity advocates inspired by books like GTD and "The 4-Hour Workweek" by startup investor Tim Ferriss. Allen promises to "transform the way you work, showing you how to pick up the pace without wearing yourself down," according to the book\'s summary on Amazon. Ferriss lays out a process to help readers escape a workaholic lifestyle. Both have resonated with an increasingly overwhelmed population: GTD has sold 2 million copies since its 2001 release, and Ferriss\' book has attracted 1.5 million buyers in North America since 2007. And no wonder. The sum of nearly all knowledge on Earth is accessible on a device in our pockets that keeps us in constant contact with our work and our friends, and helps find people we want to meet and places we want to go. This always-on communication has created an existential struggle for white-collar workers who long for work-life balance even as they heed the siren song of their email inbox\'s message alerts. For many, the world has become a burdensome, complex and never-ending to-do list. "The speed of change and the volume of potentially relevant information have gone up dramatically," says Allen. The problem isn\'t information overload, Allen believes. Instead, it\'s our addiction to our phones, emails, messages and the "likes" we get on our apps. Even worse, people are "using their head as their office," trying to remember everything from important contacts to what they need to do each day. "Your head is designed to remember four meaningful things and that\'s it," Allen says. "You\'re screwed if you\'re trying to get your brain to operate in the modern world." Little gray cells That makes sense to David Sparks, a lawyer in Orange County, Calif. "In today\'s world, we have so many more obligations than my parents did," he says. Like most of us, Sparks, 47, reaches for his phone when he wakes up. A practitioner of GTD, Sparks uses one of the many apps designed to help people manage their intricate to-do lists, parse their emails and focus their efforts. He\'s not alone. Developers now offer dozens of apps designed around to-do lists and productivity, and they release more all the time. Some of the apps reflect Ferriss\' or Allen\'s work. Some are tied to "Inbox Zero," an idea developed by productivity consultant Merlin Mann that encourages people to respond to, forward or delete emails as they receive them. That means breaking out of the habit of keeping emails around as calendar reminders or to-do lists. Think of it as the brass ring of inbox bliss: our little gray cells free from anxiety and allowed to focus on more meaningful pursuits. "Anything that helps us be more productive helps us feel good about what we\'re doing," says Ken Case, head of software company The Omni Group. App attack Case realized a decade ago that creating to-do lists wasn\'t making his work life easier. He\'d been invited to a David Allen seminar, which convinced him to create an app to manage those lists. The result was the app OmniFocus, released in 2008, which helps people break their tasks into projects. It also has a function called "review," a key teaching of Allen\'s that pushes people to plan for the coming week. Case\'s company quickly built companion apps when the iPhone App Store opened later that same year. There\'s now a version for the iPad and Apple Watch as well. "Your head is designed to remember four meaningful things and that\'s it." Other app developers have their own takes. Clear, 2Do, Things, Due and Any.do often rank at the top of the productivity category in Apple\'s App Store. It\'s not just individuals looking to get a handle on their workdays. Companies are looking for ways to cut down on emails and unnecessary meetings, too. "The tools we use to coordinate are absolutely critical," says Justin Rosenstein, co-founder of Asana, which offers business software designed to make meetings more productive. Asana is used by high-flying tech firms like Uber, Airbnb and Dropbox. The idea is that teams can hold fewer meetings and send fewer emails because the Asana system will let members know what others are doing. "It\'s about knowing who\'s responsible for each task or piece of work," says Rosenstein. "It sounds so rudimentary, but it\'s absent in so many companies." Healthy balance Some GTD fans can take it to extremes. Joe Buhlig, a 28-year-old coder for a marketing company in Buffalo, Minn., says he\'d forget to take out the trash if it weren\'t for his to-do app reminding him every week. Following GTD has helped him reduce the anxiety we\'ve all felt: What am I forgetting? Buhlig says he also keeps note cards in his back pocket to help him sketch ideas before putting them into his to-do list. That keeps him from relying too much on technology: If an apocalypse started tomorrow, he\'d just switch to paper. What of the masters? Allen says he uses a specialized program created for IBM Notes, a popular set of productivity apps once called "Lotus Notes." He also says he has an idea for something better that he sketched out two decades ago. Alas, no one\'s made it yet. Ferriss has a personal assistant but says he could survive on his own, even without an app to help. "Most techies would be disappointed by how few apps I have on my phone," he says. To him, using apps or tools is just a means to an end. "Technology is a great tool and a horrible master." Allen and Ferriss both say they don\'t need reminding to do their chores. Even so, D\'Alessio can\'t imagine life without his tech. "Everything is consistently documented throughout my day and monitored and managed so I don\'t forget anything," says D\'Alessio, who blogs about productivity. "Now I don\'t have to rely on my brain to remember things."'

aVIf bigger truly is better, Samsung has just taken the wraps off the best tablet we may have ever seen. Its name is the Galaxy View and this hefty goliath has a whopping 18.4-inch display. You read that correctly -- 18.4 inches from corner to corner of its widescreen display. It'll cost you $599 when it arrives on November 6 (UK and Australia availability and pricing are not yet confirmed, but that converts to £391 or around AU$830). Ridiculous though that might sound, Samsung reckons the View serves a noble purpose: couch potato nirvana. It's geared solely towards watching video. That's something you can already do on smaller The View is far less portable than most any other tablet, of course. It's heavy (2.65kg or 5.8 pounds), you won't fit it into a backpack (it's 452mm long by 276mm wide by 11.9mm deep), and you'll look really daft using one on the bus. It doesn't need to be tethered to a power socket though, so unlike your TV you can watch it in your bedroom, carry it into your kitchen, and even pay a visit to the bathroom, all without missing a moment of "Spongebob". It's running You can switch back to the regular Android interface if you prefer, and you'll have full access to the Google Play Store, so the full realm of Android apps and games will be available to you. With Google Docs downloaded, and with a wireless keyboard attached, the View could also make a fair replacement for a desktop all-in-one PC. It also a 2.1-megapixel camera, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, stereo speakers and support for LTE networks. Being an easily portable media machine for the home means the View is targeted much more towards families than the Android power user. As such, Samsung hasn't equipped the View with particularly high-end specs. It has a full HD display (1,920x1,080 pixels), rather than the higher resolution ultra HD screens seen on its smaller The battery is expected to provide up to 8 hours of video playback, which is enough even to sit through "The Hobbit". It has a built-in stand too, which lets it lay almost flat, making typing and sketching easier, or to stand almost upright -- better for propping up and watching flicks. Internal memory is either 64GB or 32Gb and it has a microSD cards slot. Samsung hasn't paired the View with a stylus, as with its Outlook Just as Samsung's Waning consumer interest in tablets hasn't stopped manufacturers from trying to breath some new life into the category, and Samsung is the latest to jump on the super-sized tablet bandwagon. Earlier this year Apple introduced its biggest tablet ever, the 12.9-inch We'll have a review of the Galaxy View soon.

aS'Sling TV Chief Executive Roger Lynch finished the race to launch online TV just in time for the start of a new contest between the devices that stream it. Launched in February, Sling also offers a peek at a possible future for television. As digital video options like Netflix, YouTube and Hulu have gained momentum, people\'s interest in dropping regular television subscriptions has grown. Afraid that young people and folks fed up with sky-high cable bills will forsake pay TV completely, some old-school TV companies have shown interest in backing online options like Sling. As the only service of its kind available across the US, Sling provides a glimpse at what may become the norm in your living room. The emergence of Sling TV, which is owned by traditional satellite TV provider Dish Network, comes as a clutch of tech giants vie for a place in your home. Google, Amazon and Roku all sell online set-top boxes, and on Monday, Apple began selling its updated $149 When Apple touted its new box, Chief Executive Tim Cook proclaimed that the future of television is apps. Lynch agrees. He predicts that smart televisions, the sets capable of hooking up to the Internet, will be powered by the companies making streaming boxes. That means your TV screen may look more like your phone than the current, unwieldy grid of channels, times and programs. But Lynch also viewed Apple\'s move in the direction of an App Store for television as an interesting reversal for the electronics giant. Apple TV now features a catalog of apps that contrasts with the "pretty closed environment" it previously offered. He hopes this will bring "a lot more content to Apple TV." Sling TV isn\'t among the first wave of new content on Apple TV. A Sling TV spokeswoman said the company is evaluating development of an app for Apple TV. Apple didn\'t respond to a request for comment. Customers can watch Sling TV\'s channels on the boxes and sticks made by Roku and Amazon, on the Nexus Player created by Google and Taiwanese electronics company Asus, and on Microsoft\'s Xbox 1 gaming console. Google\'s popular Chromecast stick is next on the list. A month ago, Sling said its service would be available through a dedicated app for Google\'s $35 device, which you plug directly into the back of your television. Sling wouldn\'t specify a date for its app on Chromecast to go live. Chromecast support will bring Sling TV to more people who want to navigate around their television with a mobile phone, Lynch said. Since Sling TV launched, he said, the majority of people who sign up directly create their account on their phones, even though they end up watching the most hours on their televisions. One thing that surprised Lynch as Sling TV expanded is that customers sign up and then keep their traditional pay-TV subscription too. When Sling\'s head of marketing warned him to expect these so-called "supplementers," Lynch told him that was crazy. But they make up roughly 5 percent to 10 percent of Sling customers. Sling TV declined to provide its total number of subscribers. Another surprise: For a service that hinges on live TV, on-demand content is still popular. Some channels like sports giant ESPN are still attractive mostly for live programming, but others like Food Network have a big pile of on-demand shows to watch whenever you feel like it. For channels like those, people prefer to watch on demand rather than live, and the more video the channel makes available, the more people watch, according to Lynch. "In every deal that we do, and even after the deal\'s done, we go back for more content available on demand," he said. The turnaround in attitude may be the biggest surprise. "When we were first talking to programmers about what ultimately became Sling TV, we were selling them on the idea," he said. "Now programmers who aren\'t on Sling TV are selling us on the fact that they should be."'

I personally liked the look of it standing vertically, and while the Play:5 works well as a single speaker with a wider soundstage and better clarity and bass than the previous model, if you can spring for two of these guys, you can create a stereo pair and get some real separation. In the past, Sonos did have some problems with speakers not delivering a focused stereo image (it was diffused). However, in our tests of the new Play:5, which Sonos refers to as the Play:5 (gen 2) is its set-up menu to differentiate from the This speaker appears to be about 20 to 25 percent bigger than the previous Play:5 and it delivers significantly more bass -- it\'s got 6 drivers, including 3 mid-woofers and 3 tweeters -- so if you have a pair of them it isn\'t necessary to add a separate The speakers do sound a little different depending on the way you orient them. Sonos says that when you pair them vertically they deliver "top-of-the-line stereo sound with a focused and intense sweet spot." Paired horizontally, they create "a larger stereo image" for more room-filling sound. That said, we preferred the sound when we placed them horizontally. As you\'d expect, the new speaker works with all of Sonos\' existing "smart" speakers, which are designed to be wirelessly linked together in a multiroom audio setup with an If you\'re Wi-Fi connection is a little spotty, you can opt to add a Sonos Everything is set up and controlled through a free iOS or Along with the Play:5, the company has also created a new Trueplay tuning system to help you get the best sound out of your Sonos speakers based on their placement in a particular room. Sonos discovered that customers were placing speakers in less than ideal spots -- on the floor in a corner, for instance -- and Trueplay compensates for bad placement with adjusted equalizer settings that helps punch up the bass and add more clarity.

It leaves the old Roku 2--not to mention the cheaper It also leaves behind a few beloved features. Gone is the The updated Roku 2 also sheds the old box\'s yellow, white and red analog video outputs, replacing them with an Ethernet port. That\'s a fine trade in my book, as it still works with any TV that has an HDMI input. If you\'re looking to add a streaming box to an old, pre-HD television and need those analog video outputs, the company continues to sell the analog-equipped Roku 1 unchanged. Roku\'s interface, search and app selection still lead the pack, so unless you\'re a devotee of the Apple pantheon, or find yourself inescapably enmeshed in Amazon\'s jungle of media services, Roku is the best platform for streaming. Downgrade the remote... The bad news? The new Roku 2 remote is a step down from both the old Roku 2 clicker and the one included on the new Roku 3. Those two operate via The 2015 Roku 2 remote drops those hardware extras entirely.

It\'s quite a bit slimmer than before, and its finish is matte instead of glossy, which I prefer for rejecting grime and fingerprints. I also prefer the "OK" button in the midst of the four-way cursor rather than below. And the presence of actual play/pause, rewind and fast-forward keys is highly preferable to their absence; the Compared to the Roku 3 remote, the Roku 2 remote is also missing the voice search button and the tiny mic hole, the A/B keys for gaming, and the volume controls for that absent headphone jack.

Roku\'s little The Roku 2 box itself supports Wi-Fi direct, so you can actually pair it more capable Roku remote, to add headphone support for example (see below for details).

I timed the old Roku 2 at 12 seconds to launch Netflix and 28 to launch HBO Go, and the Streaming Stick at 4 and 20 seconds respectively. The new Rokus launched those apps in about 2 and 10 seconds, respectively. (Note that in my Roku 3 review I cited slower launch times for YouTube on the Stick, but a re-test indicates that the Stick launches YouTube at around 4 seconds. Good on ya!). Why Roku rules the roost Roku 2 and Roku 3 provide the speediest access to Roku\'s platform, but what makes Roku\'s platform better than the competition? Three main reasons: an interface that treats all apps equally, the best universal search around, and the widest selection of apps, which Roku calls "channels." The inclusion of subscription services may actually save you money. If you\'re a Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu Plus or HBO Go subscriber, for example, you\'ll see results for movies available there listed as "free" in addition to those available from pay-per-view services, with costs attached.

aVJust two months after OnePlus released its Known as the OnePlus X, it's a smaller, even cheaper unlocked handset. It's the company's mid-tier option in its family of smartphones, which now has three members including the original As with its other product launches, OnePlus will make the X available by invite only. It will be sold first in the UK on November 5 for £199 (\u20ac269 in Europe) and then in the US on November 19 for $249. A special Ceramic edition (more on that later) will be available in Europe and India on November 24 with its own invitation for £269 in the UK or \u20ac369. Australian pricing hasn't been announced, but £199 converts to around AU$430. Design The X sports an elegant design with glass panels on the front and back and a metal trim. It reminds me of a bigger, updated version of the The handset comes in Onyx, which has glass that smoothly curves down the edges of the phone, and the more expensive Ceramic version, which has angled edges. The two versions are hardly discernible, but the latter does catch and reflect light in interesting ways. OnePlus also decided to manufacturer only 10,000 units of the Ceramic version. Personally, however, I prefer the Onyx. The smoothness of the glass is more comfortable in the hand and I just think it looks better up close. Like its flagship counterpart, the X has a physical button you can toggle to turn on and off notifications and sounds. OnePlus is also selling rear covers that come in several colors and materials including wood, bamboo and kevlar. For the first time, OnePlus is using an Active Matrix OLED panel for its display. The screen looked sharp and bright and having an AMOLED screen means having very deep black hues. This is because individual pixels can turn off (as opposed to an LCD display, which includes an entire backlit layer underneath), and allows features like ambient display (more on that below) to not soak up too much battery power. Hardware and key components Underneath the device's hood is a non-removable 2,525mAh battery and a quad-core 2.3GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 processor. Though it isn't as advanced as the OnePlus 2's Snapdragon 810 processing unit, the handset was zippy nonetheless when I launched apps, opened the camera and browsed the web on the Chrome browser. The 801 is also the same chipset used in other respectable flagships that launched a year ago like OnePlus' own The phone has the same dual-SIM capabilities as the OnePlus 2, Other features include 3GB of RAM and a Micro-USB port for charging and transferring files. Note that this is different from the For your casual photography needs, the device has a 13-megapixel rear-facing camera that can record up to 1080p HD video and has a f/2.2 aperture. I snapped a few photos and images looked sharp with accurate colors. The camera also operated quickly, with touch focus that adjusted smoothly. Its interface is kept to a minimum with few on-screen editing options. The front houses a 7.6-megapixel camera. For a glance at the photo quality, check out the photos below (and be sure to click on the images to see them at their full resolution). Software The handset runs OnePlus' custom OxygenOS, which is based on Android 5.1.1 Lollipop. It includes user interface themes, on-screen gestures and an ambient display. Ambient display shows you the time and missed notifications in white text without having to wake up or unlock your phone entirely. OnePlus also touted the device's pre-loaded FM radio app. Though a radio in your phone isn't anything new, the app looks nice from a design perspective. It has a minimalistic interface, with bright monochrome colors and simple, geometric shapes. Outlook Given that the OnePlus 2 is already priced at $330 (about £215 or AU$450) for the 16GB version, it's easy to imagine forgoing the $249 X altogether and forking over the extra dough for a larger display and a more powerful processor. But OnePlus phones are notoriously difficult to get ahold of and the 16GB version of the OnePlus 2 quickly ran out of stock. In some ways, this has worked in the company's favor by building up hype among its fans, but it also means there are less products available for those who actually want to buy it. While the X is available by the same invite-only routine, the company is revisiting the open-sale method as well, with hopes of making the X slightly easier to purchase. The invite-only process will last for one month after its launch and then weekly open sales will begin in the second month. By adding the X to its family of devices, OnePlus can get its products into more hands without having to wait around for the next flagship cycle. And from the looks of it so far, the X offers solid specs packaged in a sleek design for even better value. Of course, we'll know more about the OnePlus X's performance and reliability when our unit comes in. Until then, check back here for the full review.

aS'For centuries we\'ve marvelled at the feat of engineering and architecture that is the Egyptian pyramids. While their outsides are spectacular, scientists are now working out if their insides are equally as interesting. A collaborative effort between the universities in Egypt, Canada, France and Japan will soon be underway to investigate the hidden chambers of some of Egypt\'s pyramids, namely the Bent and Red pyramids at the Dahshur necropolis, and Khufu and Khafre\'s pyramids on the Giza plateau, Utilizing new technologies from Nagoya University in central Japan, the World Heritage Sites will be bombarded with radiographic muons (a technology similar to X-Ray imaging, but capable of penetrating significantly deeper objects), infrared thermography and photogrammetry in order to conduct non-invasive surveys, a technique pioneered to preserve the structure and integrity of these well renowned relics. Despite being erected over 4,000 years ago, explanations on how the pyramids were built remain scientific hypothesis. The Scan Pyramids project aims to explore the mysterious questions of exactly how the wonders were built and what lies inside them. "Several theories have been brought forward during the past century to understand the method that the ancient Egyptians used to construct the pyramids but all are still scientific hypotheses," Minister of Antiquities Mamdouh Eldamaty said to the publication, adding "this special group will study these pyramids to see whether there are still any hidden chambers or other secrets inside." The technology behind the project is also being considered in order to The Scan Pyramids project will begin in November and last until the end of 2016, perhaps more than enough time to reveal if only a few of the grand structures hidden secrets.'

aS'Xiaomi phones continue to be a hit in China, but fierce competition in the country threatens to eat away at the company\'s market share. The growing Chinese electronics brand was neck and neck with Huawei in 2015\'s third quarter, with conflicting reports on which company was China\'s top smartphone vendor. IHS Technology research provided to CNET showed Xiaomi scored a win with 16.4 percent share against fellow Chinese giant Huawei\'s 16.2 percent, while The Chinese market is tremendously important. Based largely on their sales in the People\'s Republic, Xiaomi and Huawei presently stand as the world\'s third and fifth biggest smartphone makers by marketshare respectively, Although Xiaomi only began selling phones in 2011, it\'s quickly become one of the world\'s most noteworthy brands, receiving a But it\'s not just consumers who have taken notice of Xiaomi\'s success, as many of its rivals have been using similar strategies. Vendors such as Meizu and LeTV -- which consumers outside of China may not yet have heard of -- are coming out with price competitive phones and successfully selling them throughout the country online, said Kevin Wang, an IHS Technology analyst, on Wednesday. In response to the marketshare report, Xiaomi said that its results were weaker than usual due to its product lineup going through a "transition period" during the third quarter. Additionally, in August and September, it released two new phones, the Redmi Note 2 and the Mi 4c, but had trouble sufficiently ramping up supply to meet the demand, the company added. As for its rival Huawei, the company\'s smartphone sales have been growing on better company branding and marketing, Wang said. "A lot of consumers think their phones are high quality," he said. "They have good processors inside and contain attractive features." Canalys analyst TZ Wong echoed this, saying that Huawei has been attracting Chinese consumers who want to upgrade to phones with premium features. In recent years, Huawei has been shifting to selling high-end phones, including its During the third quarter, Apple was in third place, with a 12.1 percent share.

The first wave of new apps, not surprisingly, include several ports from the existing iPhone and iPad world, everything from Zillow real estate to Periscope, the personal live broadcasting app. But most people will be buying the Apple TV for its already huge offering of video and audio channels. The good news is that nearly all of the channels from the previous Apple TV, which remains on sale for $69, are available on the new model, too. And many of the services that aren't available -- the most important one being Amazon Video -- can be streamed from any iPhone, iPad or Mac on the same Wi-Fi network at the touch of a button, using Apple's nifty AirPlay feature. A note on the terminology: We'll do our best to keep this list up to date, but expect it to change early and often, especially as Apple TV ramps up.

aVI'm staring at the screen on my Microsoft Band. I want it to tell me something. I want it to help me. Is this too much to expect out of a fitness band? Possibly. It's probably my fault. I'm overweight. I have high blood pressure. I've known about these things for years. I cover wearables and many fitness bands, and despite trying to get a routine going, it's hard to get anything to stick. I want guidance, coaching, someone to prod me and poke me. I joined Weight Watchers several times in my life, and it worked...but I stopped attending once I started losing weight. I'd love if some wearable offered me the type of constant motivation that those meetings did. Some have come close: the In 2014, I noted that The pieces didn't come together, though. The Band wasn't automatic enough, or helpful enough, to seem like a device I'd use all the time. The new Band is available now for $249 in the US, and £200 in the UK from November 19 (Australian pricing and availability isn't announced, but the UK price converts to about AU$430). It really is a slight design revamp, with an added barometer for stair-climb counting, improved heart-rate and UV sensors, and a more comfortable design sporting a curved OLED screen. It's also a $50 or £30 increase from the original. I've worn the latest band for several weeks: on its own, next to an What's new, exactly? Not all that much, compared to the previous, first-generation Microsoft Band. There's an improved heart-rate sensor, according to Microsoft (it seemed fine for me, and about as good as that on Apple Watch and Fitbit Charge HR), and a newly added barometer that tracks stair-climbing. The UV sensor now can automatically measure your exposure over time, showing estimated minutes over a workout. The rest, for the most part, is similar. Last year's Microsoft Band should offer up a lot of what this band does. In that sense, this isn't a "whole new" band, but the latest revision of Microsoft's health strategy, which has been evolving over the past year. The Band has received consistent firmware updates, and Microsoft's been tweaking its apps and Web tools over time. So, in the end, you're just getting a better-feeling band. It does, however, have an all-new design that's somewhat more comfortable and ergonomic. New curves, comfier fit Microsoft Band was a stiff black band last year, with a color touchscreen. Its battery was part of the band design, giving it a thick, cufflike feel that was far from cozy. The newly redesigned Microsoft Band is more curved, and softer and comfier to wear. But only by a bit. The rubbery band that extends from a now-curved OLED touchscreen is still really wide compared to other fitness bands. The battery's been moved down to a bulge in a chunky metal band clasp, making that part thicker. The clever pinch-and-adjust clasp design allows fit adjustment, but the whole band still gives off an aura of "Fitness Cuff." The curved OLED screen is vivid and a clear improvement, but the way I interact with it remains the same. I still need to press one of two buttons on the side to turn it on and start swiping around and tapping apps, or even to check my activity progress. A curved screen on top and a chunky metal clasp on the bottom make this a band that'll you'll either worry about scratching, or having it scratch something else. I kept taking it off as I was typing and accidentally leaving it in my office. Band as smartwatch (kinda) Microsoft Band is really, practically, Microsoft's Smartwatch. It can get notifications from your phone. It can check the weather, or your calendar, or stocks, or your Facebook messages, or Twitter updates (not tweets, but notifications and messages). It can do even more with a Windows Phone, using a microphone and Cortana for voice dictation and responding to messages (or with a built-in on-screen keyboard of sorts, too). I can set alarms. I can pay at Starbucks with a mini app that stores my barcode. But it's not a great smartwatch. The wide screen, and the way it lies perpendicular to my wrist, means I have to twist my arm awkwardly or wear the Band on my inside wrist to read messages easily. A speed-reading mode flashes large words at the press of a side button, which helps a bit, but there's no way I'd pick this over Also, just like last year, the Band has a number of mini-apps "tiles" that can be pulled on or off the Band, but you can't have all features at once. Each feature gets a tile: Twitter, Facebook, Weather, Facebook Messenger, Biking, Golf, Workouts, Exercise, Calendar. It's odd, because there aren't that many tiles, and who knows, maybe I'd suddenly like to ride a bike or start a workout, and realize that tile needs to be re-added via my phone app, and I just give up. For fitness: All-day living (with recharging) The Band is meant to stay on your wrist all the time, much like a Fitbit or

aS'Nintendo is finally entering the smartphone gaming world, and its first app title will be the free-to-play Miitomo, CEO Tatsumi Kimishima said during a strategy briefing for investors in Tokyo on Thursday. Miitomo is a "communication application that helps friends share fun personal facts and interests," the Japanese company said in a statement. Players will create avatars called Miis that they can use to engage with friends to learn more about each other and find common interests. The game itself is free, but it will include in-app purchases, Kimishima said. Though the game had been expected to be released before year\'s end, Nintendo said Thursday that Miitomo is scheduled for global release in March. Nintendo said this past March that it would begin developing mobile games, but Miitomo marks Nintendo\'s first official release in smartphone gaming after a long history of being staunchly against the proposition. While rivals Sony and Microsoft have both released games and companion apps for mobile devices, Nintendo has historically limited its releases to its own consoles and handheld gaming devices. Miitomo is being built in partnership with DeNA, a Japan-based game developer that publishes a range of free-to-play mobile games, including the popular Star Wars: Galactic Defense. The game will be the first of five from the partnership through March 2017. Miitomo will be available for both Apple iOS-based and Google Android-based mobile devices. Nintendo also announced a new membership program called My Nintendo at the investor briefing. The service is designed to connect users across different devices, including PCs, smartphones and Nintendo\'s consoles, Kimishima said. It will also enable cloud saving, so players can transfer game data from console to smartphone seamlessly. The service will launch alongside Miitomo in 2016. The Japanese company first showed movement toward smartphone gaming in March when it acquired a The move toward smartphone apps comes on the back of the company\'s first reported operating profit in five years. While strong performance in the first half of 2015 brought the company back to an operating profit of 8.98 billion yen ($74.6 million), up from 215 million yen losses the year before, the increases were still short of analyst forecasts. Investors were not excited by the game\'s unveiling and the later-than-expected release date, sending Nintendo\'s share price close to 10 percent down immediately after the announcement.'

S"The Apple's new streaming video box, available now for $149 (32GB) and $199 (64GB), comes with a bevy of new features, including a full-fledged App Store (with games!), an awesome touchpad remote and Siri-powered voice recognition. The first wave of new apps, not surprisingly, include several ports from the existing iPhone and iPad world, everything from Zillow real estate to Periscope, the personal live broadcasting app. But most people will be buying the Apple TV for its already huge offering of video and audio channels. The good news is that nearly all of the channels from the previous Apple TV, which remains on sale for $69, are available on the new model, too. And many of the services that aren't available -- the most important one being Amazon Video -- can be streamed from any iPhone, iPad or Mac on the same Wi-Fi network at the touch of a button, using Apple's nifty AirPlay feature. A note on the terminology: We'll do our best to keep this list up to date, but expect it to change early and often, especially as Apple TV ramps up. If you notice any errors or have any questions, please post a comment."

Even better. That leaves all three of its HDMI inputs free for stuff like cable boxes and game consoles. This is very new model, one introduced just a couple months back. At the time, CNET\'s David Katzmaier said it "delivers the simplest, most comprehensive smart-TV experience on the market" and Meanwhile, nearly 150 Best Buy customers gave it an average rating of 4.6 stars. So, yeah, good TV. Really good. And easy to use. Obviously the standard Roku interface is quite easy master (and already familiar to a lot of people), but here it adds tiles for the TV\'s HDMI inputs and lets you give them custom labels. Thus, just as easily as you\'d select, say, Netflix, you can choose your plugged-in Blu-ray player or TV antenna. Everything is seamlessly integrated. Videophiles may note that the Insignia has just a 60Hz refresh rate, which I consider a feature. TVs that offer 120Hz or 240Hz produce the dreaded That "issue" aside, this is a seriously sweet TV for the money.

aS'Nintendo is finally entering the smartphone gaming world, and its first app title will be the free-to-play Miitomo, CEO Tatsumi Kimishima said during a strategy briefing for investors in Tokyo on Thursday. Miitomo is a "communication application that helps friends share fun personal facts and interests," the Japanese company said in a statement. Players will create avatars called Miis that they can use to engage with friends to learn more about each other and find common interests. The game itself is free, but it will include in-app purchases, Kimishima said. Though the game had been expected to be released before year\'s end, Nintendo said Thursday that Miitomo is scheduled for global release in March. Nintendo said this past March that it would begin developing mobile games, but Miitomo marks Nintendo\'s first official release in smartphone gaming after a long history of being staunchly against the proposition. While rivals Sony and Microsoft have both released games and companion apps for mobile devices, Nintendo has historically limited its releases to its own consoles and handheld gaming devices. Miitomo is being built in partnership with DeNA, a Japan-based game developer that publishes a range of free-to-play mobile games, including the popular Star Wars: Galactic Defense. The game will be the first of five from the partnership through March 2017. Miitomo will be available for both Apple iOS-based and Google Android-based mobile devices. Nintendo also announced a new membership program called My Nintendo at the investor briefing. The service is designed to connect users across different devices, including PCs, smartphones and Nintendo\'s consoles, Kimishima said. It will also enable cloud saving, so players can transfer game data from console to smartphone seamlessly. The service will launch alongside Miitomo in 2016. The Japanese company first showed movement toward smartphone gaming in March when it acquired a The move toward smartphone apps comes on the back of the company\'s first reported operating profit in five years. While strong performance in the first half of 2015 brought the company back to an operating profit of 8.98 billion yen ($74.6 million), up from 215 million yen losses the year before, the increases were still short of analyst forecasts. Investors were not excited by the game\'s unveiling and the later-than-expected release date, sending Nintendo\'s share price close to 10 percent down immediately after the announcement.'

aS'Xiaomi phones continue to be a hit in China, but fierce competition in the country threatens to eat away at the company\'s market share. The growing Chinese electronics brand was neck and neck with Huawei in 2015\'s third quarter, with conflicting reports on which company was China\'s top smartphone vendor. IHS Technology research provided to CNET showed Xiaomi scored a win with 16.4 percent share against fellow Chinese giant Huawei\'s 16.2 percent, while The Chinese market is tremendously important. Based largely on their sales in the People\'s Republic, Xiaomi and Huawei presently stand as the world\'s third and fifth biggest smartphone makers by marketshare respectively, Although Xiaomi only began selling phones in 2011, it\'s quickly become one of the world\'s most noteworthy brands, receiving a But it\'s not just consumers who have taken notice of Xiaomi\'s success, as many of its rivals have been using similar strategies. Vendors such as Meizu and LeTV -- which consumers outside of China may not yet have heard of -- are coming out with price competitive phones and successfully selling them throughout the country online, said Kevin Wang, an IHS Technology analyst, on Wednesday. In response to the marketshare report, Xiaomi said that its results were weaker than usual due to its product lineup going through a "transition period" during the third quarter. Additionally, in August and September, it released two new phones, the Redmi Note 2 and the Mi 4c, but had trouble sufficiently ramping up supply to meet the demand, the company added. As for its rival Huawei, the company\'s smartphone sales have been growing on better company branding and marketing, Wang said. "A lot of consumers think their phones are high quality," he said. "They have good processors inside and contain attractive features." Canalys analyst TZ Wong echoed this, saying that Huawei has been attracting Chinese consumers who want to upgrade to phones with premium features. In recent years, Huawei has been shifting to selling high-end phones, including its During the third quarter, Apple was in third place, with a 12.1 percent share.

aS'Francesco D\'Alessio struggled with even basic chores. He was forgetful and had trouble keeping up with his schoolwork. After failing a year at his high school in the UK when he was 16, D\'Alessio began looking for answers. Some tech blogs suggested a book by David Allen called "Getting Things Done" (or GTD for short). In it, the productivity consultant discusses processes he developed to help high-powered executives manage the barrage of information coming at them. Four years later, D\'Alessio says those processes turned him into a successful entrepreneur and student, studying business at England\'s Plymouth University. "I\'ve been able to accomplish a lot more than the average student has," he says. Count D\'Alessio among the growing number of productivity advocates inspired by books like GTD and "The 4-Hour Workweek" by startup investor Tim Ferriss. Allen promises to "transform the way you work, showing you how to pick up the pace without wearing yourself down," according to the book\'s summary on Amazon. Ferriss lays out a process to help readers escape a workaholic lifestyle. Both have resonated with an increasingly overwhelmed population: GTD has sold 2 million copies since its 2001 release, and Ferriss\' book has attracted 1.5 million buyers in North America since 2007. And no wonder. The sum of nearly all knowledge on Earth is accessible on a device in our pockets that keeps us in constant contact with our work and our friends, and helps find people we want to meet and places we want to go. This always-on communication has created an existential struggle for white-collar workers who long for work-life balance even as they heed the siren song of their email inbox\'s message alerts. For many, the world has become a burdensome, complex and never-ending to-do list. "The speed of change and the volume of potentially relevant information have gone up dramatically," says Allen. The problem isn\'t information overload, Allen believes. Instead, it\'s our addiction to our phones, emails, messages and the "likes" we get on our apps. Even worse, people are "using their head as their office," trying to remember everything from important contacts to what they need to do each day. "Your head is designed to remember four meaningful things and that\'s it," Allen says. "You\'re screwed if you\'re trying to get your brain to operate in the modern world." Little gray cells That makes sense to David Sparks, a lawyer in Orange County, Calif. "In today\'s world, we have so many more obligations than my parents did," he says. Like most of us, Sparks, 47, reaches for his phone when he wakes up. A practitioner of GTD, Sparks uses one of the many apps designed to help people manage their intricate to-do lists, parse their emails and focus their efforts. He\'s not alone. Developers now offer dozens of apps designed around to-do lists and productivity, and they release more all the time. Some of the apps reflect Ferriss\' or Allen\'s work. Some are tied to "Inbox Zero," an idea developed by productivity consultant Merlin Mann that encourages people to respond to, forward or delete emails as they receive them. That means breaking out of the habit of keeping emails around as calendar reminders or to-do lists. Think of it as the brass ring of inbox bliss: our little gray cells free from anxiety and allowed to focus on more meaningful pursuits. "Anything that helps us be more productive helps us feel good about what we\'re doing," says Ken Case, head of software company The Omni Group. App attack Case realized a decade ago that creating to-do lists wasn\'t making his work life easier. He\'d been invited to a David Allen seminar, which convinced him to create an app to manage those lists. The result was the app OmniFocus, released in 2008, which helps people break their tasks into projects. It also has a function called "review," a key teaching of Allen\'s that pushes people to plan for the coming week. Case\'s company quickly built companion apps when the iPhone App Store opened later that same year. There\'s now a version for the iPad and Apple Watch as well. "Your head is designed to remember four meaningful things and that\'s it." Other app developers have their own takes. Clear, 2Do, Things, Due and Any.do often rank at the top of the productivity category in Apple\'s App Store. It\'s not just individuals looking to get a handle on their workdays. Companies are looking for ways to cut down on emails and unnecessary meetings, too. "The tools we use to coordinate are absolutely critical," says Justin Rosenstein, co-founder of Asana, which offers business software designed to make meetings more productive. Asana is used by high-flying tech firms like Uber, Airbnb and Dropbox. The idea is that teams can hold fewer meetings and send fewer emails because the Asana system will let members know what others are doing. "It\'s about knowing who\'s responsible for each task or piece of work," says Rosenstein. "It sounds so rudimentary, but it\'s absent in so many companies." Healthy balance Some GTD fans can take it to extremes. Joe Buhlig, a 28-year-old coder for a marketing company in Buffalo, Minn., says he\'d forget to take out the trash if it weren\'t for his to-do app reminding him every week. Following GTD has helped him reduce the anxiety we\'ve all felt: What am I forgetting? Buhlig says he also keeps note cards in his back pocket to help him sketch ideas before putting them into his to-do list. That keeps him from relying too much on technology: If an apocalypse started tomorrow, he\'d just switch to paper. What of the masters? Allen says he uses a specialized program created for IBM Notes, a popular set of productivity apps once called "Lotus Notes." He also says he has an idea for something better that he sketched out two decades ago. Alas, no one\'s made it yet. Ferriss has a personal assistant but says he could survive on his own, even without an app to help. "Most techies would be disappointed by how few apps I have on my phone," he says. To him, using apps or tools is just a means to an end. "Technology is a great tool and a horrible master." Allen and Ferriss both say they don\'t need reminding to do their chores. Even so, D\'Alessio can\'t imagine life without his tech. "Everything is consistently documented throughout my day and monitored and managed so I don\'t forget anything," says D\'Alessio, who blogs about productivity. "Now I don\'t have to rely on my brain to remember things."'

aS'Sling TV Chief Executive Roger Lynch finished the race to launch online TV just in time for the start of a new contest between the devices that stream it. Launched in February, Sling also offers a peek at a possible future for television. As digital video options like Netflix, YouTube and Hulu have gained momentum, people\'s interest in dropping regular television subscriptions has grown. Afraid that young people and folks fed up with sky-high cable bills will forsake pay TV completely, some old-school TV companies have shown interest in backing online options like Sling. As the only service of its kind available across the US, Sling provides a glimpse at what may become the norm in your living room. The emergence of Sling TV, which is owned by traditional satellite TV provider Dish Network, comes as a clutch of tech giants vie for a place in your home. Google, Amazon and Roku all sell online set-top boxes, and on Monday, Apple began selling its updated $149 When Apple touted its new box, Chief Executive Tim Cook proclaimed that the future of television is apps. Lynch agrees. He predicts that smart televisions, the sets capable of hooking up to the Internet, will be powered by the companies making streaming boxes. That means your TV screen may look more like your phone than the current, unwieldy grid of channels, times and programs. But Lynch also viewed Apple\'s move in the direction of an App Store for television as an interesting reversal for the electronics giant. Apple TV now features a catalog of apps that contrasts with the "pretty closed environment" it previously offered. He hopes this will bring "a lot more content to Apple TV." Sling TV isn\'t among the first wave of new content on Apple TV. A Sling TV spokeswoman said the company is evaluating development of an app for Apple TV. Apple didn\'t respond to a request for comment. Customers can watch Sling TV\'s channels on the boxes and sticks made by Roku and Amazon, on the Nexus Player created by Google and Taiwanese electronics company Asus, and on Microsoft\'s Xbox 1 gaming console. Google\'s popular Chromecast stick is next on the list. A month ago, Sling said its service would be available through a dedicated app for Google\'s $35 device, which you plug directly into the back of your television. Sling wouldn\'t specify a date for its app on Chromecast to go live. Chromecast support will bring Sling TV to more people who want to navigate around their television with a mobile phone, Lynch said. Since Sling TV launched, he said, the majority of people who sign up directly create their account on their phones, even though they end up watching the most hours on their televisions. One thing that surprised Lynch as Sling TV expanded is that customers sign up and then keep their traditional pay-TV subscription too. When Sling\'s head of marketing warned him to expect these so-called "supplementers," Lynch told him that was crazy. But they make up roughly 5 percent to 10 percent of Sling customers. Sling TV declined to provide its total number of subscribers. Another surprise: For a service that hinges on live TV, on-demand content is still popular. Some channels like sports giant ESPN are still attractive mostly for live programming, but others like Food Network have a big pile of on-demand shows to watch whenever you feel like it. For channels like those, people prefer to watch on demand rather than live, and the more video the channel makes available, the more people watch, according to Lynch. "In every deal that we do, and even after the deal\'s done, we go back for more content available on demand," he said. The turnaround in attitude may be the biggest surprise. "When we were first talking to programmers about what ultimately became Sling TV, we were selling them on the idea," he said. "Now programmers who aren\'t on Sling TV are selling us on the fact that they should be."'

While their outsides are spectacular, scientists are now working out if their insides are equally as interesting. A collaborative effort between the universities in Egypt, Canada, France and Japan will soon be underway to investigate the hidden chambers of some of Egypt\'s pyramids, namely the Bent and Red pyramids at the Dahshur necropolis, and Khufu and Khafre\'s pyramids on the Giza plateau, Utilizing new technologies from Nagoya University in central Japan, the World Heritage Sites will be bombarded with radiographic muons (a technology similar to X-Ray imaging, but capable of penetrating significantly deeper objects), infrared thermography and photogrammetry in order to conduct non-invasive surveys, a technique pioneered to preserve the structure and integrity of these well renowned relics. Despite being erected over 4,000 years ago, explanations on how the pyramids were built remain scientific hypothesis. The Scan Pyramids project aims to explore the mysterious questions of exactly how the wonders were built and what lies inside them. "Several theories have been brought forward during the past century to understand the method that the ancient Egyptians used to construct the pyramids but all are still scientific hypotheses," Minister of Antiquities Mamdouh Eldamaty said to the publication, adding "this special group will study these pyramids to see whether there are still any hidden chambers or other secrets inside." The technology behind the project is also being considered in order to The Scan Pyramids project will begin in November and last until the end of 2016, perhaps more than enough time to reveal if only a few of the grand structures hidden secrets.'

S'I have a confession to make. I\'m an Android guy. I\'ve always owned Samsung phones and Windows computers, and tell family members to get Amazon Fire But some of the smartest people I know swear by Apple products, and after playing with the new Apple TV for the last few days, I can see why. I\'ve tested just about every other box and stick from The remote is simply the best I\'ve ever used. Equipped with a responsive, thumb-sized touchpad it flies through menus, lists of TV show thumbnails and videos themselves, putting conventional cursor-based controls to shame. And voice search -- I guess you Apple people call it "Siri" for some reason -- works very well, and can do a lot more than just find stuff to watch. The new Apple TV is not perfect. It costs more than comparable devices -- always my main gripe about Apple products. It lets you play plenty of games, but titles originally designed for phones and tablets aren\'t necessarily as appealing on a big screen, and most work best with a third-party game controller. And it galls me that the Apple TV remote is so good, I\'d have to keep it around in addition to my My main issue though is lack of a real app for Amazon Video, my second-favorite streaming video service after Netflix. I don\'t know who to blame, Amazon or Apple or the streaming gods themselves, but regardless, it doesn\'t make any sense, especially since there\'s an Amazon app for iPhones and iPads. With Amazon\'s recent decision to If you\'re an Apple fan who owns a lot of TV shows, movies and games on Apple devices already, the new Apple TV is absolutely worth the money. For people like me, however, it\'s a tougher sell. I like To get the most out of Apple TV you need to be invested already in the Apple universe, with games, TV shows and movies you\'ve purchased from iTunes and the App Store. That\'s a shame since it offers the best streaming experience today, and more potential tomorrow once app developers go to town finding ways to exploit the big screen and that slick remote. But if the previous Apple TV was any indication, this one\'s only going to grow more appealing. Same black brick, different feel altogether It\'s been more than three and a half years since the first Apple TV went on sale, but Apple didn\'t break the physical mold. Glossy edges, rounded corners, a matte top with the requisite logo -- the two black boxes look basically identical. The new one is 0.4 inch taller, weighs 5.4 ounces more and felt like a solid brick when I pulled it out of the box. In every important way, the new Apple TV feels better than the old one to use. It starts with the new remote. It has a touchpad, a few more buttons and a familiar mic icon to evoke Siri, the name for Apple\'s disembodied female voice assistant (DFVA). Unlike Siri on a phone (or Alexa, the DFVA on Amazon\'s The remote\'s touchpad is sensitive and fast, with just the right amount of friction, and the perfect size for one-thumb operation. It took a second to realize I had to click it to select anything, rather than just tap, but immediately afterward I was blowing through menus, zooming across thumbnails and navigating quicker than with any plodding click-based control. The menus let you choose a tracking speed. As someone who loves living dangerously, I chose "fast." And those menus look different too. A clean white canvas to fill with the app icons you know from your phone, the new Apple TV home page allows nearly full customization. One of the first things I did after installing everything I wanted was to move Netflix, Hulu and HBO to the top row, along with Disney Junior for the kids, and move iTunes down a few rows since I don\'t buy many TV shows and movies from Apple. The top-row app you select expands above to show content within (as chosen by the app itself). The old Apple TV came with numerous screen savers which appear after a period of inactivity. On the new one, for now, you just have a choice of your own photos or something called Aerial (above). Trust me, you should go with Aerial. It\'s a stunning collection of cityscapes, landscapes and landmarks shot in slow motion, and looks so good you might feel reluctant to ever turn your TV off. Exploring the app store on a 65-inch screen To fill Apple TV\'s white canvas you\'ll head to the app store, which is at heart the biggest difference between the old and the new Apple TV. And again it feels a lot like the store on an iPhone or iPad, with fewer choices (for now) and bigger icons. The Purchased tab lists all of the apps you\'ve installed on other devices that are also compatible with Apple TV. You download and install them individually, picking and choosing which ones you like (although I did wish for a big "Install all" button). In most cases if you\'ve already paid for the app or game, it will be available for free on the Apple TV too -- but the decision to grandfather earlier purchases or charge you again is left up to each app\'s publisher. You\'ll have to sign in individually to each app that requires it of course, but once that happens your Apple TV will be fully armed and operational. During my test period, the store had nearly every TV-centric app available on the old box, from Netflix to PBS to NFL. It also offers most of the company\'s staples like Apple Music, Photos (which draws from your iCloud and shared photos from friends) and Computers (which can access Macs on your home network to share iTunes libraries). That\'s just the top row of the new app store, however. Others are devoted to games, apps for kids and something called "Best New Apps," which gathers in the miscellany like Periscope, QVC, Zillow and Airbnb. I\'m sure new categories will be added very soon as the app store expands, and during my test period new games and apps appeared every day. Apple says "hundreds" of apps will be available when the store opens. One-thumb gaming The first thing to know about gaming on the Apple TV is that you can always use the included remote; you don\'t need to buy a separate controller. The second thing is that with many games, a controller simply works better. Most of the titles I played worked fine with the included touchpad remote, and there\'s something to be said about gaming with one thumb. I easily could hold my infant son while I played Crossy Road, for example. That addictive chicken-smasher, with its simple controls and graphics, played beautifully and looked great on the big screen. So did JetPack Joyride and Bandland, both of which mainly consist of timed jumping. Slightly more complex controls worked well at times, for example steering on Does Not Commute (tapping either side of the pad) or swinging a bat with Beat Sports (swiping to move a bit, and swinging the controller like a Nintendo Wii). Where the touchpad controller failed for me was with quick movements requiring precise directions, like flying the ship in Geometry Wars, or directing the character to move across the map or attack something in Oceanhorn and Transistor. One of the titles with the most complex controls at launch is Galaxy on Fire: Manticore Rising (above), exclusive to Apple TV for now. A space-based arcade shooter, it incorporates the remote\'s position as well as swipes and clicks on the touchpad. It played surprisingly well considering all that, and again only required one hand. Two of the driving games, Asphalt 8 and Beach Buggy Racing, required me to put down my kid and hold the controller horizontally, like a steering wheel. Both were pretty forgiving and fun, but I definitely missed the precision of the controller. I tried most of those games with a Graphics, for what these games are, looked very impressive across the board. Even simple games like Crossy Road have been tuned up for the big screen, and higher-end titles like Galaxy on Fire and Transistor looked particularly good. A choice of sizes: 32GB vs. 64GB In true Apple fashion the box comes in two otherwise identical flavors, one with 32GB and one with 64GB of onboard storage. Unlike the Amazon Fire TV, Nvidia Shield and Roku 4 with their SD card slots, there\'s no way to add storage yourself if you need it. If you\'re really into gaming on Apple TV, then the more expensive version with twice the storage might be worthwhile. But people used to filling up their phones and tablets with photos, videos and games should realize that Apple TV accesses photos and video via the cloud, so they don\'t need to be stored on the device itself. That leaves games, and Apple TV\'s operating system, TVOS, uses an a aggressive storage management system. It mandates small initial downloads (just 200MB per app) augmented by "on-demand resources," little chunks of data that can be downloaded quickly and deleted at need if the device fills up. The end result is that only very heavy gamers should expect to need the 64GB version. What can you watch on Apple TV? For a comprehensive list of Apple TV\'s current TV and audio apps versus the competition, check out our Games and miscellaneous apps are neat, but most of the hours on the new Apple TV will be logged watching TV. And with the glaring exception of Amazon, the Apple TV is as good as any TV-based streamer for video app access. Yes, you can use'

aVI'm staring at the screen on my Microsoft Band. I want it to tell me something. I want it to help me. Is this too much to expect out of a fitness band? Possibly. It's probably my fault. I'm overweight. I have high blood pressure. I've known about these things for years. I cover wearables and many fitness bands, and despite trying to get a routine going, it's hard to get anything to stick. I want guidance, coaching, someone to prod me and poke me. I joined Weight Watchers several times in my life, and it worked...but I stopped attending once I started losing weight. I'd love if some wearable offered me the type of constant motivation that those meetings did. Some have come close: the In 2014, I noted that The pieces didn't come together, though. The Band wasn't automatic enough, or helpful enough, to seem like a device I'd use all the time. The new Band is available now for $249 in the US, and £200 in the UK from November 19 (Australian pricing and availability isn't announced, but the UK price converts to about AU$430). It really is a slight design revamp, with an added barometer for stair-climb counting, improved heart-rate and UV sensors, and a more comfortable design sporting a curved OLED screen. It's also a $50 or £30 increase from the original. I've worn the latest band for several weeks: on its own, next to an What's new, exactly? Not all that much, compared to the previous, first-generation Microsoft Band. There's an improved heart-rate sensor, according to Microsoft (it seemed fine for me, and about as good as that on Apple Watch and Fitbit Charge HR), and a newly added barometer that tracks stair-climbing. The UV sensor now can automatically measure your exposure over time, showing estimated minutes over a workout. The rest, for the most part, is similar. Last year's Microsoft Band should offer up a lot of what this band does. In that sense, this isn't a "whole new" band, but the latest revision of Microsoft's health strategy, which has been evolving over the past year. The Band has received consistent firmware updates, and Microsoft's been tweaking its apps and Web tools over time. So, in the end, you're just getting a better-feeling band. It does, however, have an all-new design that's somewhat more comfortable and ergonomic. New curves, comfier fit Microsoft Band was a stiff black band last year, with a color touchscreen. Its battery was part of the band design, giving it a thick, cufflike feel that was far from cozy. The newly redesigned Microsoft Band is more curved, and softer and comfier to wear. But only by a bit. The rubbery band that extends from a now-curved OLED touchscreen is still really wide compared to other fitness bands. The battery's been moved down to a bulge in a chunky metal band clasp, making that part thicker. The clever pinch-and-adjust clasp design allows fit adjustment, but the whole band still gives off an aura of "Fitness Cuff." The curved OLED screen is vivid and a clear improvement, but the way I interact with it remains the same. I still need to press one of two buttons on the side to turn it on and start swiping around and tapping apps, or even to check my activity progress. A curved screen on top and a chunky metal clasp on the bottom make this a band that'll you'll either worry about scratching, or having it scratch something else. I kept taking it off as I was typing and accidentally leaving it in my office. Band as smartwatch (kinda) Microsoft Band is really, practically, Microsoft's Smartwatch. It can get notifications from your phone. It can check the weather, or your calendar, or stocks, or your Facebook messages, or Twitter updates (not tweets, but notifications and messages). It can do even more with a Windows Phone, using a microphone and Cortana for voice dictation and responding to messages (or with a built-in on-screen keyboard of sorts, too). I can set alarms. I can pay at Starbucks with a mini app that stores my barcode. But it's not a great smartwatch. The wide screen, and the way it lies perpendicular to my wrist, means I have to twist my arm awkwardly or wear the Band on my inside wrist to read messages easily. A speed-reading mode flashes large words at the press of a side button, which helps a bit, but there's no way I'd pick this over Also, just like last year, the Band has a number of mini-apps "tiles" that can be pulled on or off the Band, but you can't have all features at once. Each feature gets a tile: Twitter, Facebook, Weather, Facebook Messenger, Biking, Golf, Workouts, Exercise, Calendar. It's odd, because there aren't that many tiles, and who knows, maybe I'd suddenly like to ride a bike or start a workout, and realize that tile needs to be re-added via my phone app, and I just give up. For fitness: All-day living (with recharging) The Band is meant to stay on your wrist all the time, much like a Fitbit or

aS'Since it was first introduced in March 2013, the Roku 3 box has been our The new Roku 2 offers all of the goodness of the Roku interface and app selection (including Netflix, Hulu Plus, Amazon Prime, Vudu, Watch ESPN, HBO Go and In case you read that last section too quickly, let me reiterate: now the Roku 2 is just as fast as the Roku 3, and matches or beats the speed of pretty much any other streaming device we\'ve tested, regardless of processor specs, RAM and other numbers. It leaves the old Roku 2--not to mention the cheaper It also leaves behind a few beloved features. Gone is the The updated Roku 2 also sheds the old box\'s yellow, white and red analog video outputs, replacing them with an Ethernet port. That\'s a fine trade in my book, as it still works with any TV that has an HDMI input. If you\'re looking to add a streaming box to an old, pre-HD television and need those analog video outputs, the company continues to sell the analog-equipped Roku 1 unchanged. Roku\'s interface, search and app selection still lead the pack, so unless you\'re a devotee of the Apple pantheon, or find yourself inescapably enmeshed in Amazon\'s jungle of media services, Roku is the best platform for streaming. Downgrade the remote... The bad news? The new Roku 2 remote is a step down from both the old Roku 2 clicker and the one included on the new Roku 3. Those two operate via The 2015 Roku 2 remote drops those hardware extras entirely. It\'s a standard infrared clicker you need to aim at the box, and you\'ll have to keep the box\'s IR sensor exposed to work, a requirement that eliminates Otherwise it\'s dead-simple to use and I have no complaints. It\'s quite a bit slimmer than before, and its finish is matte instead of glossy, which I prefer for rejecting grime and fingerprints. I also prefer the "OK" button in the midst of the four-way cursor rather than below. And the presence of actual play/pause, rewind and fast-forward keys is highly preferable to their absence; the Compared to the Roku 3 remote, the Roku 2 remote is also missing the voice search button and the tiny mic hole, the A/B keys for gaming, and the volume controls for that absent headphone jack. Three of the four direct-app keys are the same, but the fourth is for Sling TV on the Roku 2 (and the latest Roku 1) and Hulu Plus on the Roku 3. Meanwhile the latest version of the Stick remote gets direct access to Google Play. Roku\'s little The Roku 2 box itself supports Wi-Fi direct, so you can actually pair it more capable Roku remote, to add headphone support for example (see below for details). And of course, if you\'re going to use a Note, however, that if you use Roku\'s free iOS or ...but pump the responsiveness Operational speed is something I consider extremely important in a living room box you\'ll use every day. In my speed tests the Roku 3 (both the old 2013 and new 2015 versions) and the Roku 2 simply flew around the bases, responding equally fast to button presses, launching and navigating apps, populating thumbnails, grabbing search results and whizzing around the system menus. When it comes to getting your shows on-screen pronto, the new Rokus will outrun most cable boxes, disc players and Smart TV systems, not to mention your phone (that\'s Compared to the Apple TV, Google Nexus Player and Amazon Fire TV (both On the other hand the new Rokus (and the old Roku 3) trounced the old Roku 2 and Roku 1 and, to a lesser extent the Streaming Stick, in both navigation and launching apps. I timed the old Roku 2 at 12 seconds to launch Netflix and 28 to launch HBO Go, and the Streaming Stick at 4 and 20 seconds respectively. The new Rokus launched those apps in about 2 and 10 seconds, respectively. (Note that in my Roku 3 review I cited slower launch times for YouTube on the Stick, but a re-test indicates that the Stick launches YouTube at around 4 seconds. Good on ya!). Why Roku rules the roost Roku 2 and Roku 3 provide the speediest access to Roku\'s platform, but what makes Roku\'s platform better than the competition? Three main reasons: an interface that treats all apps equally, the best universal search around, and the widest selection of apps, which Roku calls "channels." The inclusion of subscription services may actually save you money. If you\'re a Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu Plus or HBO Go subscriber, for example, you\'ll see results for movies available there listed as "free" in addition to those available from pay-per-view services, with costs attached. When I looked for "The Lego Movie" for example, Roku\'s search results told me I could watch it for free on HBO Go, $9.99 on Vudu, Amazon or M-Go, and $14.99 on CinemaNow. The same search of'

I personally liked the look of it standing vertically, and while the Play:5 works well as a single speaker with a wider soundstage and better clarity and bass than the previous model, if you can spring for two of these guys, you can create a stereo pair and get some real separation. In the past, Sonos did have some problems with speakers not delivering a focused stereo image (it was diffused). However, in our tests of the new Play:5, which Sonos refers to as the Play:5 (gen 2) is its set-up menu to differentiate from the This speaker appears to be about 20 to 25 percent bigger than the previous Play:5 and it delivers significantly more bass -- it\'s got 6 drivers, including 3 mid-woofers and 3 tweeters -- so if you have a pair of them it isn\'t necessary to add a separate The speakers do sound a little different depending on the way you orient them. Sonos says that when you pair them vertically they deliver "top-of-the-line stereo sound with a focused and intense sweet spot." Paired horizontally, they create "a larger stereo image" for more room-filling sound. That said, we preferred the sound when we placed them horizontally. As you\'d expect, the new speaker works with all of Sonos\' existing "smart" speakers, which are designed to be wirelessly linked together in a multiroom audio setup with an If you\'re Wi-Fi connection is a little spotty, you can opt to add a Sonos Everything is set up and controlled through a free iOS or Along with the Play:5, the company has also created a new Trueplay tuning system to help you get the best sound out of your Sonos speakers based on their placement in a particular room. Sonos discovered that customers were placing speakers in less than ideal spots -- on the floor in a corner, for instance -- and Trueplay compensates for bad placement with adjusted equalizer settings that helps punch up the bass and add more clarity. You calibrate your speaker -- or speakers -- using a free app and the microphone on your iPhone or'
