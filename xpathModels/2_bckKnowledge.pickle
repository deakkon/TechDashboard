Featuring a stainless steel case, chrome hands, silicone straps and a tachymeter-inspired sub-dial the Activité Steel is geared towards men's fashion but can also be seen as the more premium version of the Activité Pop watch.The timepiece counts your steps, sleep and swimming activities in real time and acts a silent alarm just like the previous Activités. The Steel's battery lasts up to eight months without a single charge. Activité Steel also features two hand dials, one showing the time and a sub-dial showing the percentage of your daily step goal achieved. The step goal is set within the free Withings Health Mate application (available on both iOS and Android platforms). It also automatically detects activities (such as running and swimming) and will transition to monitor sleep when worn at night. The device is water-resistant up to 50 meters.At just $169.95 (about £112, AU$240), it will initially be available in classic black and is exclusively sold from the Withings Store.

aVNews iPhone 6C release date rumour resurfaces as mid-2016 iPhone 6C release date rumour resurfaces as mid-2016 By John McCann, Mobile phones The second-generation polycarbonate iPhone is refusing to die Shares Murmurings of a second generation polycarbonate iPhone are refusing to die, with the latest rumour tipping the iPhone 6C release date for mid-2016.This latest prediction comes from IHS analyst Kevin Wang, who took to his Weibo account to make the claim - although he did tip the iPhone 6C to arrive by the end of the year back in August, so this needs to be taken with a pinch of salt.It's been more than two years since Apple launched the iPhone 5C, a plastic covered iPhone 5 with a price tag lower than the iPhone 5S it arrived alongside - but it wasn't as cheap as many had hoped.How low can you go?Even though Wang may not have the most glittering of track records, we're still holding out hope for the arrival of the iPhone 6C.It's been rumoured ever since the 5C launched, and it's fair to say many questions have been raised over its potential existence since - but the same can be said for the iPad Pro.Apple's supersized tablet was rumoured for years, almost to the point where people were starting to believe it would never happen.But it did, and we reckon Apple is playing a similar game with the iPhone 6C. Especially because of the muted response the 5C garnered, the Cupertino firm is probably making sure its next "colourful" iteration is really worth it.Everything we know about the iPhone 6CVia GforGames Tags iPhone Related news The iPhone 6C may turn out to be a metal iPhone 7C iPhone 6C release date, news and rumors iOS 9.1 is breaking TouchID for some iPhone users SwiftKey's new keyboard can double your typing speed See more Mobile phones news Load Comments

aVWithings, popular for its Activité watch line has unveiled a new connected wearable called the Activité Steel. Featuring a stainless steel case, chrome hands, silicone straps and a tachymeter-inspired sub-dial the Activité Steel is geared towards men's fashion but can also be seen as the more premium version of the Activité Pop watch.The timepiece counts your steps, sleep and swimming activities in real time and acts a silent alarm just like the previous Activités. The Steel's battery lasts up to eight months without a single charge. Activité Steel also features two hand dials, one showing the time and a sub-dial showing the percentage of your daily step goal achieved. The step goal is set within the free Withings Health Mate application (available on both iOS and Android platforms). It also automatically detects activities (such as running and swimming) and will transition to monitor sleep when worn at night. The device is water-resistant up to 50 meters.At just $169.95 (about £112, AU$240), it will initially be available in classic black and is exclusively sold from the Withings Store.

aS'Murmurings of a second generation polycarbonate iPhone are refusing to die, with the latest rumour tipping the iPhone 6C release date for mid-2016.This latest prediction comes from IHS analyst Kevin Wang, who took to his Weibo account to make the claim - although he did tip the iPhone 6C to arrive by the end of the year back in August, so this needs to be taken with a pinch of salt.It\'s been more than two years since Apple launched the iPhone 5C, a plastic covered iPhone 5 with a price tag lower than the iPhone 5S it arrived alongside - but it wasn\'t as cheap as many had hoped.How low can you go?Even though Wang may not have the most glittering of track records, we\'re still holding out hope for the arrival of the iPhone 6C.It\'s been rumoured ever since the 5C launched, and it\'s fair to say many questions have been raised over its potential existence since - but the same can be said for the iPad Pro.Apple\'s supersized tablet was rumoured for years, almost to the point where people were starting to believe it would never happen.But it did, and we reckon Apple is playing a similar game with the iPhone 6C. Especially because of the muted response the 5C garnered, the Cupertino firm is probably making sure its next "colourful" iteration is really worth it.Everything we know about the iPhone 6CVia GforGames Tags iPhone Related news The iPhone 6C may turn out to be a metal iPhone 7C iPhone 6C release date, news and rumors iOS 9.1 is breaking TouchID for some iPhone users SwiftKey\'s new keyboard can double your typing speed See more Mobile phones news'

Handily, Apple has a new program to help you do just that. It's call iPhone Annual Upgrade Program. Instead of forking out the full up-front price, you pay a monthly installment.
